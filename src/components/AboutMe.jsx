      <p>
        Ever since I was young, I&apos;ve always been curious about how things
        work. I grew up with a fascination in art and technology, derived from a
        strong passion for video game development.
      </p>

      <p>
        Whether it was repairing broken hardware, programming the way a game
        character moves, or solving issues in a piece of code, I knew that I
        loved the thrill of putting something together and making it work.
      </p>

      <p>
        That thrill, fascination, and curiosity is what led me to become the web
        developer I am today.
